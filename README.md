# Color_Sorting_6DOF_Robot
Using a non-working CRS F3 robot that was stripped and fitted with new modern hardware, this robot sorts colored objects in their designated locations.  
Key features:  
- High precision high torque closed-loop servo motors from Teknic.  
- Custom inverse kinematics (special thanks to Chris Annin for helping)  
- Custom controls algorithm  
- Custom Servo and logic controller using Allen Bradley Compact Logix PLC  
- Custom software written in Python and C++  
- Vision system using Arduino and Piximon camera  
- Custom wiring and PCBs
